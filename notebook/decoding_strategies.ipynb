    "# Demonstrating Different Decoding Strategies with Hugging Face Transformers\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore various decoding strategies for text generation using a small encoder-decoder model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. We'll apply these strategies to two different datasets:\n",

    "- Translation task where deterministic strategies are expected to perform better.\n",
    "- Summarization task where stochastic strategies might yield more diverse and informative outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Greedy Search\n",
    "2. Beam Search\n",

    "4. Top-k Sampling\n",
